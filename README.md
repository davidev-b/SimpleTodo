# SimpleTodo

This is a Todo App in SwiftUI using CoreData. It is a good demo to demonstrate the amazing combination of CoreData in SwiftUI by adding, removing entities items and combining many different elements like List, EditButton, NavigationBar.
Also it makes use of MVVM pattern, however being little bit limited due to @FetchRequest being available inside SwiftUI view only.
